       </table><!--Arrhenius concept-->
       <h3 class="h3" >Arrhenius concept of Acids and bases</h3>
      <p> According to the concept(1787):</p>
     <p><Dfn>Acid</Dfn> is a substance which dissociate in aqueous solution to give hydrodgen<br>
        ions.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In genertal the ionization of acids,take place as follows.</p>
        <p>HA &rarr;<sup>water</sup>H<sup>+</sup>+A<sup>-</sup></p>
        <p>For example,substance such as HCl,HNO<sub>3</sub>,CH<sub>3</sub>COOH,HCN,etc.,are acids<br>
             because they ionize in aqueous to provide H<sup>+</sup> ions.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HCl &rarr;<sup>water</sup>&nbsp; H<sup>+</sup>+Cl<sup>-</sup></p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HNO<sub>3</sub>&rarr;<sup>water</sup>H<sup>+</sup>+ NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup></p>  
       <p><a href="base.html">Base </a>is a substance which dissociate in water to give hydroxide ions</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The general formula of Base take place as follows:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BOH &rarr;<sup>water</sup>B<sup>+</sup>+OH<sup>-</sup></p>
    <p>The substances such as NaOH,KOH,NH<sub>4</sub>.,etc,are bases becacuse <br>
    these compounds ionize in aqueous solutions ti provide OH<sup>-</sup> ions.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NaOH&rarr;<sup>water</sup>Na<sup>+</sup>+OH<sup>-</sup></p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CaOH&rarr;<sup>water</sup> Ca<sup>+2</sup>+2(OH)<sup>-</sup></p>
    <p>Thus, according to Concept:</p>
    <!--Important-->
    <h6>Acids give H<sup>+</sup>ions in water and bases give OH<sup>-</sup>ions in water.</h6>
    <h3>limitations of Arrhenius concept:-</h3>
     <ol>
        <li> <p>  This concept is applicable only in aqueous medium and does not explain<br>
            nature of acid and base in non-aqueous medium.</p>
        </li> 
        <li><p>According to the concept,acids and bases are only those compounds which<br>
             contain Hydrogen and Hydroxide ions,respectively.It can't explain the nature<br>
              of componds like CO<sub>2</sub>,NH<sub>3</sub>.,etc,which are acid and base </p></li>
     </ol>
     <!--Brownted-lowry concept-->
     <h3 class="h3">Brownsted-Lowry Concept</h3>
     <p>In 1923,the Danish chemist Bronsted and the German chemist Lowry independently<br>
    presented their theories of acid and base on the basis of proton transfer.</p>
    <p> <dfn>Acid</dfn> is a substance that donate a proton from another substance.</p>
    <p><dfn> Base</dfn> is a substance that accapt a proton from another substance. </p>
    <p>For example ,HCl acts as an acid while NH<sub>3</sub>acts as a base.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HCl   +   NH<sub>3</sub>&rarr;  NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>  +  Cl<sup>-</sup></p>
    <h3>Conjugate Acid:-</h3> 
    <p>A conjugate acid is a specie fpormed by accepting a proton by base.</p>
    <h3>Conjugate Base:-</h3>
    <p>A conjugate base is a specie formed by donating a proton by acid.</p>
    <p>    Thus,their example as follows:-</p>
     <p>HCL+ H<sub>2</sub>O &rarr;H<sub>3</sub>O&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; +&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cl<sup>-</sup><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;Acid&nbsp; base&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;conjugate-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;conjugate-<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;acid&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;base
    </p>

<p>According to the Brownsted-Lowry concept,An acid and a base always work <br>
    to transfer a proton.THat means ,a substance can act an acid only when<br>
     another substance simultaneouslybehaves a base.HENce ,a substance can <br>
     act as an acid as well as base ,depending upon the nature of another substance.</p>
     <h3>Amphoteric:-</h3>
     <p>A substance that behave an acid asd well as base is an Amphoteric.</p>
     <h3>Limitations:-</h3>
     <p>It has been observed that their are certain substance that behaves an acid <br>though they do not have the ability to donate a proton .,e.g,SO<suB>3.</suB></p>
     <p>Similarly,CaO behaves as a base but it has not abilityto accept a proton.</p> 
     <!--Lewis concept-->
     <h3 class="h3">Lewis Concept of acid and base</h3>
     <p>The Arrhenius and Brownsted-Lowry concept are limited to substancer that <br>
        contain protons.G.N.Lewis proposed a more general and broader concept of acid<br>
         and base</p>
    <p> <a href="acid.html">Acid</a>is a substance which can accept a pair of electrons.</p>
    <p><a href="base.html">Base</a>is a substance which can donate a pair of electrons.</p>
    <p>For example,a reaction between Ammonia and Boron Trifluoride take place by forming<br>
         a coordinate covalent bond between ammonia and boron trifluoride by donating an <br>
         elctron pair of ammonia and boron  accepting a pair of electron by boron trifluoride. </p> 
         <p>
         According to the Lewis concept.The following speice can act as <h3> Lewis Acid;</h3>
         </p>
         <ol>
            <li><p>Molecule in which the central atom has incomplete octet.For example,<br>
            in BF<sub>3</sub>etc,the central atoms have only six electrons around them,<br>therefore these can accept an electron pair</p></li>
            <li><p>Simple cations can act as lewis Acids. All cations act as lewis acids<br>
                 since they have defficint in electrons. HOwever ,cations such as <br>
                 Na<sup>+</sup>ions etc.,have a very little tendency to accept an<br>
                  electrons.While the cations like H<sup>+</sup>ions,etc.,have a greater <br>
                  electron accepting tendency therefore act as Lewis acid</p></li>
         </ol>
         <p>According to the  Lewis concept, the following specie can act as <h3>lewis base</h3></p>
         <ol>
          <li><p>Nuetral specie having at least one lone pair of electrons .for examlpe<br>
         Ammonia ,Amines ,Alcohol etc., act as Lewis base because they contain a lone pair<br>
          of electron </p></li>
          <li><p>Negatively charged species or anions.For example chloride ,cyanideetc., act as Lewis .</p></li>

        <!--Indicators-->
        <h3 class="h3">Indicators</h3>
        <p>Indicators are the organic compounds.They have different colours in acidic and <br>basic solutions.Litmus is a common indicator.It is red in acidic solution<br>and blue in alkaline soiution.
        </p>
        <p>Each indicator has a specific colour in acidic medium which changes at a specific pH to another colour in basic medium.</p>

      <!-- Salt -->
     <h3 class="3">Salts</h3>
     <p>Salts are ionic compounds generally formed by the nurtralization of an acid and base.</p>
     <p> Salts are made up of positive and negative ions .A cation ia metallic ion is derived<br>from a base ,therefore,it is called basic radical.While anion is derived from acid therefore it is called acid radical</p>
     <p>A salt gets its name from the name of the metal and the acid.</p>
     <h3>Characteristics of Salts:-</h3>
     <ol>
    <li> <p>Salts are the organic compounds found in crystalline solid.</p></li>
    <li><p>They have high melting and boiling points.</p></li>
    
    <li><p>Most of the salts contains water of crystallization which is responsible for the shape of the crystals.<br>
       Number of molecules of water are specific for each salt and they are written with the <a href="chemicalf.html"></a>chemical formula of salt.<br>
       For example,<br>
       Copper sulphate=CuSO<sub>4.5H<sub>2</sub>O
    </p></li>
    <li><p>Salts are nuetral compounds.Although,they do not compose of equal number <br>
    of positive and negative ions,but they have equal numbers of positive and negative <br>
charges.</p></li>
